Slandis

The attached code reads a data file and performs some data preparation
including get dummies and standard scaler.  Data was then split into test/train datasets
in order to run the data
through a neural network model
3 attempts were made to optimize the model
with an evaluation summary prepared after testing each model

The target variable is the "Is_Successful" field
There were 43 original features including all fields in the csv file and their corresponding resulting fields after get_dummies
